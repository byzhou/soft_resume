\noindent \textbf{Recent Projects}
\begin{itemize}

		\item \verb+Malware Detection using Hardware Performance Counters and Machine Learning+

I used automation in python to conduct interactions with more than 1000 software and malware, and measure 
the Hardware Performance Counter (HPC) values attached to these binaries. I built a cluster of 
machines to accelerate the measuring process using Rabbitmq. I performed data analysis on
these HPC values using various machine learning algorithms, such as K Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision 
Tree (DT), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), Naive Bayes, AdaBoost and Random Forest (RF). By applying 
these machine learning algorithms, I evaluated the robustness of malware detection using these algorithms
in cross-validations.  


		\item \verb+Evercookie Tracker+

I built a browser extension to discover evercookies, the cookies that cannot be removed
by users, from the newly-visited website. The extension I built can send the website information 
to a remote server for further evaluation. If the evercookie is discovered through dynamic analysis, 
the extension updates the blacklist of websites that have evercookies. I ran the backend with 
man-in-the-middle proxy server running on a virtual machine. 


		\item \verb+Hardware Detection using Optical Imaging Methods+

I developed a Hardware Trojan (HT) Detection method using optical imaging. I automated the gate
generation process and provided optical structures for simulation. I used the optical signatures
from each gate to generate circuit responses over a large area. I also used KNN, DT, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
to analyze the imaged results in order to classify different gates to detect HTs. 
		
\end{itemize}


\noindent \textbf{Internship Experience}
    \begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Design Engineer at Qualcomm Inc. Santa Clara, CA, September.2016-December.2016}\\
I implemented a Digital Signal Processing Module in the chip design. I modeled my signal processing
in Python withe builder design pattern. My model brought the flexibility into parameter changing and 
future developments in modular designs. In addition to designing the models, I also provided the websites for documenting the
tools during the developments. Meanwhile, I automated Verilog connection using Python 
and other scripting languages.
        \item \textbf{Design Engineer at Analog Device Inc. Wilmington, MA, June.2015-August.2015}\\
        and \textbf{Design Engineer at Analog Device Inc. San Jose, CA, June.2014-August.2014}\\
In these two internships, I mainly explored the Real Number Modeling in chip modeling and also board 
module modeling. I used Verilog, Verilog-ams, and SystemVerilog to module the current and voltage 
behaviors.
