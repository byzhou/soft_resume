    \begin{itemize}
        \item Modeling ADP1048 PFC chip's application power stage with
        voltage-input-current-output feedback loop and chip's analog components,
        using Cadence Verilog-ams and verilog testbench for close loop
        simulation. Exploring the model with System Verilog to achieve
        consistency between \textit{Analog Device Inc.} Adice5 analog simulation
        and \textit{Cadence Incisive} digital simualtion. 
    \end{itemize}

\noindent \textbf{Research Experience, Oct.2013-May.2014, Sept.2014-Dec.2014}
%\textit{Accelerating Digital Logic Circuits Using Equalizers}
		\begin{itemize}
            \item Exploring the use of feedback equalization techniques to
            enhance the operating frequency of standard digital CMOS logic
            while consuming lower energy and mitigating timing errors. The
            proposed feedback equalizer lowers down the rise/fall time of
            the critical path based on the data sampled in the previous
            clock cycle. 

            \item Exploring equalization and bypassing techniques to mitigate
            the effects of transistor aging and post-fabrication
            variations in digital logic circuit designs.
